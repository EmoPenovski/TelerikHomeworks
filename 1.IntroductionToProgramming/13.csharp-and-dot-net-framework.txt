C# is a programming language, .NET is a blanket term that tends to cover both the .NET Framework 
(an application framework library) and the Common Language Runtime which is the runtime in which .NET assemblies are run.
Microsoft's implementation of C# is heavily integrated with the .NET Framework so it is understandable that the two concepts would be confused. 
However it is important to understand that they are two very different things.

Here is a class written in C#:

class Example { }

Here is a class written in C# that explicitly uses a .NET framework assembly, type, and method:

class Example
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Here we call into the .NET framework to 
        // write to the output console
        System.Console.Write("hello, world");
    }
}


.NET isn't just a library, but also a runtime for executing applications. C# is a language, 
.NET is an application framework. The .NET libraries can run on the CLR and thus any language 
which can run on the CLR can also use the .NET libraries. C# is designed for Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), 
which consists of the executable code and runtime environment that allows use of various high-level languages 
to be used on different computer platforms and architectures.
